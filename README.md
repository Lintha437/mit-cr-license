# The MIT License - Commercial Restriction (MIT-CR)

The MIT License - Commercial Restriction (MIT-CR) is a modification of the traditional MIT license, introducing specific guidelines for commercial use. While the license retains the permissive nature of the MIT license for non-commercial purposes, it requires a separate commercial license for any commercial use, unlike the traditional MIT license which permits both commercial and non-commercial use freely.

**FOR MORE DETAILS, PLEASE REFER TO THE FULL LICENSE TEXT AT [The MIT-CR License](https://github.com/Lintha437/mit-cr-license/blob/main/src/The%20MIT-CR%20License%20Version%201.0.pdf).**



## Rationale

MIT-CR is particularly useful for developers who want to allow wide usage of their software in non-commercial environments while maintaining control over commercial applications. This license is ideal for projects such as free software, educational samples, and personal projects where developers wish to encourage non-commercial use but ensure that commercial applications are properly licensed and compensated.

The traditional MIT license provides broad freedom, including commercial use, which can lead to developers losing control over how their work is monetized. MIT-CR addresses this by preserving the freedoms of the traditional MIT license for non-commercial use but requiring commercial users to obtain a separate license, ensuring developers retain control over commercial applications.



**Non-Commercial Use**

In non-commercial scenarios, MIT-CR operates similarly to the traditional MIT license. Users are granted the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and sublicense the software freely, provided that these activities are not for commercial purposes. The copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.



**Commercial Use**

For commercial use, MIT-CR does not prohibit such activities outright but differs from the traditional MIT license by requiring a separate commercial license agreement. This means that while the software can still be used for commercial purposes, you must first contact the copyright holder(s) to obtain a commercial license. Commercial use includes, but is not limited to, selling copies of the software, incorporating the software into a product for sale, or using the software to generate revenue. For inquiries regarding commercial licensing, please contact the copyright holder(s).
